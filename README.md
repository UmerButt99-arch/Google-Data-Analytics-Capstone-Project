## Project Overview
In this project, I aimed to analyze a dataset and provide insights using various data analytics tools and techniques. The project is divided into different stages, including data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and data visualization.
- **R Visualizations**: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and custom visualizations.

## Project Details
The project involves analyzing a dataset from [mention the source or nature of the dataset]. The key objectives of the project are:
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Analyzing the data to uncover trends and patterns.
- Visualizing the data to communicate findings effectively.

### SQL
I used SQL to extract and transform data from the dataset. Some of the key queries and their purposes are:
- **Data Extraction**: Extracted relevant data from the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis.

### Tableau
In Tableau, I created several interactive dashboards to visualize the data. These dashboards provide insights into various aspects of the dataset, such as:
- **Overview Dashboard**: A summary of the key metrics and KPIs.
- **Trend Analysis Dashboard**: Visualizations showing trends over time.
- **Geographic Analysis Dashboard**: Insights based on geographical data.

### R Visualizations
Using R, I performed detailed statistical analysis and created custom visualizations to highlight specific insights from the data. Some of the visualizations include:
- **Histograms and Boxplots**: To understand the distribution of data.
- **Scatter Plots**: To identify correlations between variables.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize density and intensity of data points.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [mention the source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. The data includes information on [brief description of the dataset].

## Visualizations
